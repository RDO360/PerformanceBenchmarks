# Performance Benchmarks

## Bitrate and VMAF benchmark

This scripts benchmarks the bitrate and the VMAF of videos with differents encoding parameters. A description of the script parameters is available inside the script.

### Example Usage

```powershell
bitrateVmafBenchmark.ps1 -tiles "Rockets1.y4m", "Rockets2.y4m", "Rockets3.y4m", "Rockets4.y4m", "Rockets5.y4m", "Rockets6.y4m", "Rockets7.y4m", "Rockets8.y4m", "Rockets9.y4m", "Rockets10.y4m", "Rockets11.y4m", "Rockets12.y4m", "Rockets13.y4m", "Rockets14.y4m", "Rockets15.y4m", "Rockets16.y4m", "Rockets17.y4m", "Rockets18.y4m", "Rockets19.y4m", "Rockets20.y4m", "Rockets21.y4m", "Rockets22.y4m", "Rockets23.y4m", "Rockets24.y4m", "Rockets25.y4m", "Rockets26.y4m", "Rockets27.y4m", "Rockets28.y4m", "Rockets29.y4m", "Rockets30.y4m", "Rockets31.y4m", "Rockets32.y4m", "Rockets33.y4m", "Rockets34.y4m", "Rockets35.y4m", "Rockets36.y4m" -codecs "h264_nvenc", "hevc_nvenc" -presets "p1", "p2", "p3", "p4", "p5", "p6", "p7" -cqs 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 -heights 0, 320 -segmentTime 2 -segmentGOP 60 -segmentDirectory ".\segments" -dataFile data.csv -vmafLogDirectory "vmafLogs"
```

## Encoding Speed Benchmark

This script benchmarks the time needed to encode videos with different encoding parameters. A description of the script parameters is available inside the script.

### Example Usage

```powershell
encodingSpeedBenchmark.ps1 -tiles "Rockets1.y4m", "Rockets2.y4m", "Rockets3.y4m", "Rockets4.y4m", "Rockets5.y4m", "Rockets6.y4m", "Rockets7.y4m", "Rockets8.y4m", "Rockets9.y4m", "Rockets10.y4m", "Rockets11.y4m", "Rockets12.y4m", "Rockets13.y4m", "Rockets14.y4m", "Rockets15.y4m", "Rockets16.y4m", "Rockets17.y4m", "Rockets18.y4m", "Rockets19.y4m", "Rockets20.y4m", "Rockets21.y4m", "Rockets22.y4m", "Rockets23.y4m", "Rockets24.y4m", "Rockets25.y4m", "Rockets26.y4m", "Rockets27.y4m", "Rockets28.y4m", "Rockets29.y4m", "Rockets30.y4m", "Rockets31.y4m", "Rockets32.y4m", "Rockets33.y4m", "Rockets34.y4m", "Rockets35.y4m", "Rockets36.y4m" -codecs "h264_nvenc", "hevc_nvenc" -presets "p1", "p2", "p3", "p4", "p5", "p6", "p7" -cqs 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38 ,40 -heights 0, 320 -repetitions 5 -segmentTime 2 -segmentGOP 60 -segmentDirectory ".\segment" -dataFile data.csv
