# Performance Benchmarks

## Installation

1. Install the latest version of [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/), including `pip`
1. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. To execute the [experiments](#experiments), install [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) on your operating system.
1. To run the [Spatial and Temporal Information experiment](#spatial-and-temporal-information), install the requirements of the [siti-tools](https://github.com/VQEG/siti-tools#requirements).

## Experiments

The experiments generate the primary data needed for the research.

### Spatial and Temporal Information

This script calculates the spatial and temporal information of videos according to the [ITU-T P.910 (07/2022) recommendation](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.910-202207-I/en) using the [reference software](https://github.com/VQEG/siti-tools).
A description of the script parameters is available inside the script.

#### Example Usage

```powershell
siTi.ps1 -tiles "Rockets1.y4m", "Rockets2.y4m", "Rockets3.y4m", "Rockets4.y4m", "Rockets5.y4m", "Rockets6.y4m", "Rockets7.y4m", "Rockets8.y4m", "Rockets9.y4m", "Rockets10.y4m", "Rockets11.y4m", "Rockets12.y4m", "Rockets13.y4m", "Rockets14.y4m", "Rockets15.y4m", "Rockets16.y4m", "Rockets17.y4m", "Rockets18.y4m", "Rockets19.y4m", "Rockets20.y4m", "Rockets21.y4m", "Rockets22.y4m", "Rockets23.y4m", "Rockets24.y4m", "Rockets25.y4m", "Rockets26.y4m", "Rockets27.y4m", "Rockets28.y4m", "Rockets29.y4m", "Rockets30.y4m", "Rockets31.y4m", "Rockets32.y4m", "Rockets33.y4m", "Rockets34.y4m", "Rockets35.y4m", "Rockets36.y4m" -resultsDirectory siti
```

### Bitrate and VMAF Benchmark

This script benchmarks the bitrate and the VMAF of videos with differents encoding parameters.
A description of the script parameters is available inside the script.

#### Example Usage

```powershell

```

### Encoding Speed Benchmark

This script benchmarks the time needed to encode videos with different encoding parameters.
A description of the script parameters is available inside the script.

#### Example Usage

```powershell
encodingSpeedBenchmark.ps1 -tiles "Rockets1.y4m", "Rockets2.y4m", "Rockets3.y4m", "Rockets4.y4m", "Rockets5.y4m", "Rockets6.y4m", "Rockets7.y4m", "Rockets8.y4m", "Rockets9.y4m", "Rockets10.y4m", "Rockets11.y4m", "Rockets12.y4m", "Rockets13.y4m", "Rockets14.y4m", "Rockets15.y4m", "Rockets16.y4m", "Rockets17.y4m", "Rockets18.y4m", "Rockets19.y4m", "Rockets20.y4m", "Rockets21.y4m", "Rockets22.y4m", "Rockets23.y4m", "Rockets24.y4m", "Rockets25.y4m", "Rockets26.y4m", "Rockets27.y4m", "Rockets28.y4m", "Rockets29.y4m", "Rockets30.y4m", "Rockets31.y4m", "Rockets32.y4m", "Rockets33.y4m", "Rockets34.y4m", "Rockets35.y4m", "Rockets36.y4m" -codecs "h264_nvenc", "hevc_nvenc" -presets "p1", "p2", "p3", "p4", "p5", "p6", "p7" -cqs 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38 ,40 -heights 0, 320 -repetitions 5 -segmentTime 2 -segmentGOP 60 -segmentDirectory ".\segment" -dataFile data.csv

## Analysis

The analysis plot the primary data generated by the experiments.
The following analyses are available :
- Spatial and temporal information (`plotSiTi.py`)
- Bjøntegaard-Delta rate (`plotBdRate.py`)
- Bitrate (`plotBitrate.py`)
- VMAF (`plotVmaf.py`)
- Encoding speed (`plotEncodingSpeed.py`)
- Encoding speed comparison (`comparedEncodingSpeed.py`)

For usage, see each script in the `analysis` directory.
